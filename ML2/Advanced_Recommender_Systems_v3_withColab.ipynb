        "Recommendation Systems usually rely on larger data sets and specifically need to be organized in a particular fashion. Because of this, we won't have a project to go along with this topic, instead we will have a more intensive walkthrough process on creating a recommendation system with Python with the same Movie Lens Data Set.\n",

        "\n",
        "Two most common types of recommender systems are **Content-Based** and **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**. \n",
        "\n",
        "* Collaborative filtering produces recommendations based on the knowledge of users’ attitude to items, that is it uses the \"wisdom of the crowd\" to recommend items. \n",
        "* Content-based recommender systems focus on the attributes of the items and give you recommendations based on the similarity between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Collaborative Filtering\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, Collaborative filtering (CF) is more commonly used than content-based systems because it usually gives better results and is relatively easy to understand (from an overall implementation perspective). The algorithm has the ability to do feature learning on its own, which means that it can start to learn for itself what features to use. \n",
        "\n",
        "CF can be divided into **Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering** and **Model-Based Collaborative filtering**. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will implement Model-Based CF by using singular value decomposition (SVD) and Memory-Based CF by computing cosine similarity. \n",
        "\n",
        "## The Data\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use famous MovieLens dataset, which is one of the most common datasets used when implementing and testing recommender engines. It contains 100k movie ratings from 943 users and a selection of 1682 movies.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can download the dataset [here](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip) or just use the u.data file that is already provided on a GitHub.\n",

Matrix factorization is widely used for recommender systems where it can deal better with scalability and sparsity than Memory-based CF. The goal of MF is to learn the latent preferences of users and the latent attributes of items from known ratings (learn features that describe the characteristics of ratings) to then predict the unknown ratings through the dot product of the latent features of users and items. \n",

You fit this matrix to approximate your original matrix, as closely as possible, by multiplying the low-rank matrices together, which fills in the entries missing in the original matrix.\n",

By applying matrix factorization the model learns that important user features are _age group (under 10, 10-18, 18-30, 30-90)_, _location_ and _gender_, and for movie features it learns that _decade_, _director_ and _actor_ are most important. Now if you look into the information you have stored, there is no such feature as the _decade_, but the model can learn on its own. The important aspect is that the CF model only uses data (user_id, movie_id, rating) to learn the latent features. If there is little data available model-based CF model will predict poorly, since it will be more difficult to learn the latent features. \n",
